### Service "ObjectService"

`ObjectService` provides API for manipulating objects. Object operations do
not interact with sidechain and are only served by nodes in p2p style.


### Method Get

Receive full object structure, including Headers and payload. Response uses
gRPC stream. First response message carries object with requested address.
Chunk messages are parts of the object's payload if it is needed. All
messages, except the first one, carry payload chunks. Requested object can
be restored by concatenation of object message payload and all chunks
keeping receiving order.

             

__Request Body:__ GetRequest.Body

GET Object request body

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| address | Address | Address of the requested object |
| raw | bool | If `raw` flag is set, request will work only with objects that are physically stored on the peer node |
                                      

__Response Body__ GetResponse.Body

GET Object Response body

| Field | Type | Description |

| chunk | bytes | Chunked object payload |
| split_info | SplitInfo | Meta information of split hierarchy for object assembly. |
                     
### Method Put

Put the object into container. Request uses gRPC stream. First message
SHOULD be of PutHeader type. `ContainerID` and `OwnerID` of an object
SHOULD be set. Session token SHOULD be obtained before `PUT` operation (see
session package). Chunk messages are considered by server as a part of an
object payload. All messages, except first one, SHOULD be payload chunks.
Chunk messages SHOULD be sent in direct order of fragmentation.

                       

__Request Body:__ PutRequest.Body

PUT request body

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |

### Method Head

Returns the object Headers without data payload. By default full header is
returned. If `main_only` request field is set, the short header with only
the very minimal information would be returned instead.

                  

__Request Body:__ HeadRequest.Body

Object HEAD request body

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| address | Address | Address of the object with the requested Header |

| id_list | ObjectID | List of `ObjectID`s that match the search query |
    
### Method GetRange

Get byte range of data payload. Range is set as an (offset, length) tuple.
Like in `Get` method, the response uses gRPC stream. Requested range can be
restored by concatenation of all received payload chunks keeping receiving
order.

__Response Body__ GetRangeResponse.Body

Get Range response body uses streams to transfer the response. Because
object payload considered a byte sequence, there is no need to have some
initial preamble message. The requested byte range is sent as a series
chunks.

| chunk | bytes | Chunked object payload's range. |
| split_info | SplitInfo | Meta information of split hierarchy. |
                         
### Method GetRangeHash

Returns homomorphic or regular hash of object's payload range after
applying XOR operation with the provided `salt`. Ranges are set of (offset,
length) tuples. Hashes order in response corresponds to ranges order in
request. Note that hash is calculated for XORed data.

set of all `Object` structure's fields except `payload`.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |

| signature | Signature | Signed `ObjectID` |
| header | Header | Object metadata headers |
       
### Message HeaderWithSignature

Tuple of full object header and signature of `ObjectID`. \
Signed `ObjectID` is present to verify full header's authenticity through the
following steps:

1. Calculate `SHA-256` of marshalled `Header` structure
2. Check if the resulting hash matched `ObjectID`
3. Check if `ObjectID` signature in `signature` field is correct

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| header | Header | Full object header |
| signature | Signature | Signed `ObjectID` to verify full header's authenticity |
     
### Message PutRequest.Body.Init

Newly created object structure parameters. If some optional parameters
are not set, they will be calculated by a peer node.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| object_id | ObjectID | ObjectID if available. |
| signature | Signature | Object signature if available |
| header | Header | Object's Header |
| copies_number | uint32 | Number of the object copies to store within the RPC call. By default object is processed according to the container's placement policy. |
     
### Message Range

Object payload range.Ranges of zero length SHOULD be considered as invalid.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| offset | uint64 | Offset of the range from the object payload start |
| length | uint64 | Length in bytes of the object payload range |
     
### Message SearchRequest.Body.Filter

Filter structure checks if object header field or attribute content
matches a value.

If no filters set, search request will return all objects of the
container, including Regular object, Tombstones and Storage Group
objects. Most human users expect to get only object they can directly
work with. In that case the `$Object:ROOT` filter should be used.

By default `key` field refers to the corresponding object's `Attribute`.
Some Object's header fields can also be accessed by adding `$Object:`
prefix to the name. Here is the list of fields available via this prefix:

* $Object:version \
  version
* $Object:objectID \
  object_id
* $Object:containerID \
  container_id
* $Object:ownerID \
  owner_id
* $Object:creationEpoch \
  creation_epoch
* $Object:payloadLength \
  payload_length
* $Object:payloadHash \
  payload_hash
* $Object:objectType \
  object_type
* $Object:homomorphicHash \
  homomorphic_hash
* $Object:split.parent \
  object_id of parent
* $Object:split.splitID \
  16 byte UUIDv4 used to identify the split object hierarchy parts

There are some well-known filter aliases to match objects by certain
properties:

* $Object:ROOT \
  Returns only `REGULAR` type objects that are not split or are the top
  level root objects in a split hierarchy. This includes objects not
  present physically, like large objects split into smaller objects
  without separate top-level root object. Other type objects like
  StorageGroups and Tombstones will not be shown. This filter may be
  useful for listing objects like `ls` command of some virtual file
  system. This filter is activated if the `key` exists, disregarding the
  value and matcher type.
* $Object:PHY \
  Returns only objects physically stored in the system. This filter is
  activated if the `key` exists, disregarding the value and matcher type.

Note: using filters with a key with prefix `$Object:` and match type
`NOT_PRESENT `is not recommended since this is not a cross-version approach.
Behavior when processing this kind of filters is undefined.

| Field | Type | Description |

`Attribute` is a user-defined Key-Value metadata pair attached to the
object.

Key name must be a object-unique valid UTF-8 string. Value can't be empty.
Objects with duplicated attribute names or attributes with empty values
will be considered invalid.

There are some "well-known" attributes starting with `__NEOFS__` prefix
that affect system behaviour:

* __NEOFS__UPLOAD_ID \
  Marks smaller parts of a split bigger object
* __NEOFS__EXPIRATION_EPOCH \
  Tells GC to delete object after that epoch

And some well-known attributes used by applications only:

* Name \
  Human-friendly name
* FileName \
  File name to be associated with the object on saving
* Timestamp \
  User-defined local time of object creation in Unix Timestamp format
* Content-Type \
  MIME Content Type of object's payload

For detailed description of each well-known attribute please see the
corresponding section in NeoFS Technical specification.
