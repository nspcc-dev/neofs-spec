## neo.fs.v2.session



### Service "SessionService"

`SessionService` allows to establish a temporary trust relationship between
two peer nodes and generate a `SessionToken` as the proof of trust to be
attached in requests for further verification. Please see corresponding
section of NeoFS Technical Specification for details.


### Method Create

Open a new session between two peers.

Statuses:
- **OK** (0, SECTION_SUCCESS):
session has been successfully opened;
- Common failures (SECTION_FAILURE_COMMON).

### Message SessionToken

NeoFS Session Token.

| id | bytes | Token identifier is a valid UUIDv4 in binary form |
| owner_id | OwnerID | Identifier of the session initiator |
| lifetime | TokenLifetime | Lifetime of the session |
| session_key | bytes | Public key used in session |
| object | ObjectSessionContext | ObjectService session context |
| container | ContainerSessionContext | ContainerService session context |
   
### Message SessionToken.Body.TokenLifetime

Lifetime parameters of the token. Field names taken from rfc7519.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| exp | uint64 | Expiration Epoch |
| nbf | uint64 | Not valid before Epoch |
| iat | uint64 | Issued at Epoch |
   
### Message XHeader

Extended headers for Request/Response. They may contain any user-defined headers
to be interpreted on application level.

Key name must be a unique valid UTF-8 string. Value can't be empty. Requests or
Responses with duplicated header names or headers with empty values will be
considered invalid.

There are some "well-known" headers starting with `__NEOFS__` prefix that
affect system behaviour:

* __NEOFS__NETMAP_EPOCH \
  Netmap epoch to use for object placement calculation. The `value` is string
  encoded `uint64` in decimal presentation. If set to '0' or not set, the
  current epoch only will be used.
* __NEOFS__NETMAP_LOOKUP_DEPTH \
  If object can't be found using current epoch's netmap, this header limits
  how many past epochs the node can look up through. The `value` is string
  encoded `uint64` in decimal presentation. If set to '0' or not set, only the
  current epoch will be used.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| key | string | Key of the X-Header |
| value | string | Value of the X-Header |
