# Incentive model

Economic of NeoFS uses GAS stored in NeoFS contract in the mainchain. It increases with user deposits and decreases after withdrawals. Therefore, assets don't appear out of nowhere and don't go nowhere. All internal accounts and settlements are managed by Balance contract in the sidechain. Every epoch many settlements take place, which we can divide into two groups:

- data storage payments,
- service fees.
