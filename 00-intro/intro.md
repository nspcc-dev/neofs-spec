# Introduction

## Overview

\Gls{NeoFS} is a decentralized distributed object storage system integrated with the [Neo Blockchain](https://neo.org).

We store and distribute users' data across a peer-to-peer network of \Glspl{Node}. Whether a business or an individual, any Neo user may join the network and get paid for providing storage resources to others, or pay a competitive price to employ NeoFS as a storage solution.

The decentralized architecture and flexible storage policies allow users to reliably store object data in the NeoFS network. Each \Gls{Node} is responsible for executing the specific storage policies selected by the user, including the geographical location, redundancy level, number of nodes, type of disk, capacity, etc. Thus, NeoFS enables a transparent data placement process which gives full control over data to the users.

Deep [Neo Blockchain](https://neo.org) integration allows NeoFS to be used by \glspl{dApp} directly from [NeoVM](https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/basic/technology/neovm.html) on the [Smart Contract](https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/basic/technology/neocontract.html) code level. As a result, dApps are not limited to on-chain storage and one can manipulate large amounts of data without paying a prohibitive price.

NeoFS provides native [gRPC](https://grpc.io) \Gls{api} and supports popular protocol gateways such as [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html), [HTTP](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol), [FUSE](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace), and [sFTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol), which allows developers to easily integrate their existing applications without rewriting code.

Together, this set of features makes it possible to utilize a dApp's Smart Contract to manage monetary assets and obtain data access permissions on NeoFS through a regular Web Browser or a mobile application.
