\newglossaryentry{NeoVM}{
  name={Neo Virtual Machine},
  description={
    NeoVM is a lightweight virtual machine for executing Neo smart contracts. As the core component of Neo, NeoVM has Turing completeness and high consistency, which can implement arbitrary execution logic and ensure consistent execution results of any node in distributed network, providing strong support for decentralized applications.

\newglossaryentry{HRW}{
  name=HRW,
  description={
    HRW stands for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_hashing}{Rendezvous hashing}. It helps to achieve 3 goals:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Select nodes uniformly from the whole netmap. This means that every node has a chance to be included in container nodes set.
      \item Select nodes deterministically. Identical (netmap, storage policy) pair results in the same placement set on every storage node.
      \item Prioritize nodes providing better conditions.
    \end{enumerate}
    Nodes having more space, better price or better rating are to be selected with higher probability. Specific weighting algorithm is defined for NeoFS network as a whole and is beyond scope of this document. See \href{https://github.com/nspcc-dev/hrw}{NeoFS HRW implementation} for details.
