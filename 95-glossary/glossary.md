Object
 : The immutable piece of data with a metadata in form of a set of key-value headers. Object has a globally unique identifier.

HRW
 : HRW stands for (Rendezvous hashing)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_hashing]. It helps to achieve 3 goals:

1. Select nodes uniformly from the whole netmap. This means that every node has a chance to be included in container nodes set.
2. Select nodes deterministically. Identical (netmap, storage policy) pair results in the same placement set on every storage node.
3. Prioritize nodes providing better conditions.

Nodes having more space, better price or better rating are to be selected with higher probability. Specific weighting algorithm is defined for NeoFS network as a whole and is beyond scope of this document. See [NeoFS HRW implementation](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/hrw) for details.
