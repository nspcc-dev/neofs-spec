### reputation contract

Reputation contract is a contract deployed in NeoFS side chain\.

Inner Ring nodes produce data audit for each container in each epoch\. In the end nodes produce DataAuditResult structure that contains information about audit progress\. Reputation contract provides storage for such structures and simple interface to iterate over available DataAuditResults on specified epoch\.

During settlement process\, Alphabet nodes fetch all DataAuditResult structures from the epoch and execute balance transfers from data owners to Storage and Inner Ring nodes\, if data audit succeed\.

#### Contract notifications

Reputation contract does not produce notifications to process\.

#### Contract methods

##### Get

```go
func Get(epoch int, peerID []byte) [][]byte
```

Get method returns list of all stable marshaled DataAuditResult structures produced by specified Inner Ring node in specified epoch\.

##### GetByID

```go
func GetByID(id []byte) [][]byte
```

GetByID method returns list of all stable marshaled DataAuditResult with specified id\. Use ListByEpoch method to obtain id\.

##### ListByEpoch

```go
func ListByEpoch(epoch int) [][]byte
```

ListByEpoch returns list of IDs that may be used to get reputation data with GetByID method\.

##### Migrate

```go
func Migrate(script []byte, manifest []byte, data interface{}) bool
```

Migrate method updates contract source code and manifest\. Can be invoked only by contract owner\.

##### Put

```go
func Put(epoch int, peerID []byte, value []byte)
```

Put method saves DataAuditResult in contract storage\. Can be invoked only by Inner Ring nodes\. Does not require multi signature invocations\.

Epoch is an epoch number when DataAuditResult structure was generated\. PeerID contains public keys of Inner Ring node that produced DataAuditResult\. Value contains stable marshaled structure of DataAuditResult\.

##### Version

```go
func Version() int
```

Version returns version of the contract\.
