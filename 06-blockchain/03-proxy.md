### proxy contract

Proxy contract is a contract deployed in NeoFS side chain\.

Proxy contract pays for all multi signature transaction executions when notary service enabled in side chain\. Notary service prepares multi signed transaction\, however they should contain side chain GAS to be executed\. It is inconvenient to ask Alphabet nodes to pay for these transactions: nodes can change over time\, some nodes will spend side chain GAS faster\, it creates economic instability\.

Proxy contract exists to solve this issue\. While Alphabet contracts hold all side chain NEO\, proxy contract holds most of the side chain GAS\. Alphabet contracts emits half of the available GAS to the proxy contract\. Address of the Proxy contract is used as the first signer in the multi signature transaction\. Therefore NeoVM executes Verify method of the contract and if invocation is verified\, then Proxy contract pays for the execution\.

#### Contract notifications

Proxy contract does not produce notifications to process\.

#### Contract methods

##### Migrate

```go
func Migrate(script []byte, manifest []byte, data interface{}) bool
```

Migrate method updates contract source code and manifest\. Can be invoked only by contract owner\.

##### OnNEP17Payment

```go
func OnNEP17Payment(from interop.Hash160, amount int, data interface{})
```

OnNEP17Payment is a callback for NEP\-17 compatible native GAS contract\.

##### Verify

```go
func Verify() bool
```

Verify method returns true if transaction contains valid multi signature of Alphabet nodes of the Inner Ring\.

##### Version

```go
func Version() int
```

Version returns version of the contract\.
